## Archived Github Repositories

These are some of my really really really old Github repos that probably don't work anymore.

#### [Spring MVC/Bootstrap/AngularJS Starter](https://github.com/wvuong/spring-mvc-bootstrap-angularjs-starter)
Get up and running quickly with Spring MVC with Bootstrap and AngularJS in place. Just clone and run `mvn jetty:run`.

#### [Logback Request](https://github.com/wvuong/logback-request)
A Logback appender and Servlet filter that writes the messages logged during the lifecycle of the request into the response HTML as JSON. You can then read and render the JSON as you want (or use the included Angular directive to render them in a table).

#### [Arduino BBQ Smoker](https://github.com/wvuong/bbqsmoker)
Arduino sketch and design for a device that reads and displays probe temperatures. Eventually, there might be temperature reporting and actively actuating a fan or something.

#### [Septacular](https://github.com/wvuong/septacular-twitter-android)
A simple Twitter client written for Android 2.3 that read Septa's tweets and notify you of service changes.
