One of the more delightful features of Go that I've discovered is the [embed package](https://pkg.go.dev/embed) which is a combination of compiler directive and standard library. With the embed package, project resources are bundled into the binary and assigned to the annotated struct field. For example from their docs:

```
import _ "embed"

//go:embed hello.txt
var s string

print(s)
```

To embed all files with the package, you can use a glob expression on an `embed.FS`:

```
//go:embed *
var assetsFS embed.FS

data, _ := assetsFS.ReadFile("hello.txt")
```

Really useful for loading internal game assets!
